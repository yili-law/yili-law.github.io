Hi, my name is Yi Li. I am currently a data compliance lawyer at [Chery Automobile](https://www.cheryinternational.com/), where I focus on GDPR, data compliance, and regulatory compliance.

Before joining Chery, I worked as a lawyer in [Jia Yuan Law Offices](https://www.jiayuan-law.com/en/index.aspx) for over two years, where I focused on commercial law, intellectual property (IP), and information technology (IT) law. My work involved providing legal support to law firms in China, particularly in the area of private equity investment. I participated in fifteen due diligence projects, leading four of them. Additionally, I offered compliance advisory services to state-owned enterprises (SOEs) undergoing reform.

I received my master's degrees from [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/) and [the University of Göttingen](https://www.uni-goettingen.de/en/), and my bachelor’s degree from [East China University of Political Science and Law](https://www.ecupl.edu.cn/).

I am passionate about legal frameworks related to data protection, artificial intelligence (AI), and new technologies. Over time, I have developed particular expertise in key European Union regulations, including the GDPR, the AI Act, and the Digital Services Act.

I am always eager to explore how legal knowledge can be applied to support innovation and responsible technology development. I’m especially interested in continuing to grow in the areas of privacy, data protection, and open-source governance, while contributing to projects that involve intellectual property, IT law, and commercial legal practice.
