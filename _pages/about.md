My name is Yi Li. I am a lawyer with over two years of experience specializing in commercial law, IP, and IT law. I have provided legal support to law firms in China, particularly in private equity investment, and I received my legal education from prestigious universities in both China and Europe. I recently obtained the CIPP/E (Certified Information Privacy Professional/Europe) certification, demonstrating my knowledge of European data protection laws and privacy regulations.

Some examples of my work and study experiences include:

- As a lawyer at [Jia Yuan Law Offices](https://www.jiayuan-law.com/en/index.aspx), I participated in 15 due diligence projects, leading 4 of them. I also provided compliance advisory services for state-owned enterprises (SOEs) undergoing reform.
- During my studies at [University of Göttingen](https://www.uni-goettingen.de/en/), I participated in the AI Act Workshop, where I handled compliance with open-source license issues for an explainable AI tool in the medical field, which sparked my strong interest in open-source licensing.
- At the Data Economy Law Summer School, I collaborated on a group case study addressing compliance issues related to data-oriented business models. I focused on GDPR compliance, and my contributions were highly recognized by both my tutor and fellow participants, deepening my understanding of GDPR.

I am passionate about navigating legal frameworks related to data protection, artificial intelligence (AI), and emerging technologies. I've developed expertise in European Union laws such as the GDPR, AI Act, and Digital Services Act. I stay attuned to emerging tools like ChatGPT, which enhance my productivity and research skills.

I'm excited about opportunities where I can contribute my legal expertise, especially in the areas of intellectual property, information technology, and commercial law, and I'm particularly interested in expanding into privacy and data protection.
